============================

My GH:P site

I created this site because I wasn't happy with the information density provided by the default view within GitHub; especially when viewing a profile for the first time.

You can view a profile other than my own by appending `name` as a query param such as `http://timdownsisarealboy.github.io/?name=zbuc`
